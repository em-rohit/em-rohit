ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Rohit â€” a software developer with 7+ years of experience, passionate about building real-world solutions.

Over the years, Iâ€™ve worked with a broad set of technologies and domains, wearing many hats across development and IT. I'm a full-stack developer at heart with strong skills in JavaScript, React, Java, Android, Python, Data Science, and AI â€” with an eye for clean architecture and good design.

I enjoy exploring the entire stack, from crafting intuitive frontends to building robust backends, working with databases, and leveraging cloud and DevOps practices.

Iâ€™m always learning, open to impactful collaborations, and driven by a desire to grow and contribute to meaningful projects.
